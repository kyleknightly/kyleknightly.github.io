        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I do not wish to pretend expertise in any of these fields, 
            but rather to suspend my ignorance and try to find some connections 
            between them in the meantime. I am writing this as an exploration, 
            and I welcome and expect corrections on my explanations and speculations. 
            However, I also aim for this paper to be welcoming to those who shy away 
            from a paper as soon as mathematics makes its first appearance–my job is 
            just to share my excitement about math and its connection with living things. 
            I will begin by explaining fairly simple concepts partially to keep the larger 
            subject from slipping out from beneath me, but also to establish a method of 
            building an understanding of the more complicated topics, while discussing 
            the method’s limitations. Some of these topics are modeled after nature, 
            elegant explanations of natural phenomena. Others are abstract, where the 
            math was put first and allowed to think freely.</p>
